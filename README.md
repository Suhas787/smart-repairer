# smart-repairer
Smart Repairer connects drivers with mechanics instantly. Drivers request help by sharing their GPS location and photos of the issue. Repairers view requests on a real-time dashboard, accept jobs, and navigate to the driver. The system tracks job status from "Request" to "Completed" and allows for digital payments and driver reviews.
